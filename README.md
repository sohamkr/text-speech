Speech-to-Text & Real-Time Transcription Project
1. Approach & Methodology
This project focuses on implementing a real-time speech-to-text system using Python, leveraging pre-trained Whisper ASR models.
The system supports both real-time transcription and audio file-based transcription, integrating an interactive frontend for user-friendly accessibility.

3. Data Preprocessing & Selection
For optimal speech recognition, audio data needs preprocessing. This includes:
- Resampling** audio to 16kHz (required for Whisper models).
- Noise Reduction** for improving transcription accuracy.
- Conversion to Mel-Spectrograms** (handled internally by the model).
- Dataset Selection:** Audio samples were either recorded in real-time or uploaded for transcription.

3. Model Architecture & Tuning Process
The model used for transcription is OpenAI's Whisper ASR. The approach involved:
- Choosing Whisper's Pre-Trained Model:** Different model sizes (tiny, base, small, medium,   large) were tested.
- Fine-Tuning (Optional):** The model was fine-tuned with a custom dataset if necessary.
- Error Correction:** Basic text processing was applied to refine the output and fix punctuation inconsistencies.

4. Performance Results & Next Steps
 Performance Results:
- Accuracy:** The system performs well on clear speech, but struggles slightly with noisy environments.
- Latency:** Near real-time performance is achieved for short utterances.
- Limitations:** The model may misinterpret words in dialects it wasnâ€™t trained on.

# Next Steps:
- Enhancing real-time processing** by optimizing the inference pipeline.
- Improving dialect adaptation** by training on region-specific datasets.
- Deploying as a web app** with Streamlit or Flask for broader accessibility.
